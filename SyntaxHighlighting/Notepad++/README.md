These are user-defined languages (UDLs) for Notepad++, created for SAS4A/SASSYS-1
input/output files. This file was created for Version 5.3.

They can be imported into Notepad++ by going to 'Language' -> 'Define Your Language...'
and then selecting the 'Import...' button.

These files have all the SAS inputs, block names, and module names as keywords, and will
color them accordingly. By default, the .inp and .out file extensions will be associated
with these languages, and any .inp/.out file loaded will have these colorations.
